# symbolcounter.py
Written by Ian Patterson  
  
Counter of various symbols, letters, and ASCII characters.  
Storer of various JSON files. 
Collector of not very useful data. 
 
Originally made to see how to set up my keyboard profile for my 40% layout Vortex Core, I wanted to see which symbols I use the most while programming so I can set up my keybindings different.  
Maybe it's useful to someone else.
